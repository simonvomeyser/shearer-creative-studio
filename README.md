SHEARER Creative Studio
</h1>

Great project for the modern, gender-neutral hair salon "SHEARER Creative Studio".

[https://shearer.studio](https://shearer.studio)

Implemented with React and Gatsby as a statically rendered page, with a creative design and modern animations - at the same time keeping top results in terms of Lighthouse Score and SEO. Gatsby is still a great tool for static sites that need to be hosted without Node and serve a lot of images.

The great CD comes from Katharina Link, the screen design was developed together with Felix Rostig and Damian Brzostewicz.
